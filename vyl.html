        <p class="mono-stat">[WHAT IS VYL?]</p>
        <p class="mono-stat">
          VYL is a hot-swappable systems language. It transpiles to C and then compiles to machine code.
          It doesn't operate through any interpreters or virtual machines. Instead, it has a runtime that
          watches the file that's running, and when it's written to, injects the changes into a shared
          object file with the <code>.vylo</code> extension.
        </p>
        
        <p class="mono-stat">[WHY SHOULD I USE VYL?]</p>
        <p class="mono-stat">
  I'm not going to hold you on anything; this is a language that I feel is missing from the
  general programming landscape. I've always liked languages like C, C++, and Rust, but I feel
  that they have always been either a syntax hell, or an eyesore and confusing to read.
  VYL is designed to have the readability of Python, the speed of C, and the safety of Rust.
</p>
  
  


<p class="mono-stat">[WHY NOT JUST USE X LANGUAGE?]</p>
<p class="mono-stat">
  Go ahead, use what you want. I'm not going to stop you. This language is just something I
  made to be a C replacement. You can use any language you want, except Zig. Zig looks
  terrible. I feel VYL is much better to look at and easier to read and write than C/C++.
</p>
  
  


<p class="mono-stat">[GOALS]</p>
<p class="mono-stat">
  The main goal of VYL is to be fully finished and ready to use.
  The secondary goal is to build a community around VYL.
  The third, and final goal that I am making as the creator, is to finish any tools around it,
  like the VYL linker, VYL package manager, and improve the smart compiler.
    
  

  Any other goals are up to the community.
</p>
  
  


<p class="mono-stat">[WHAT VYL IS AND ISN'T]</p>
<p class="mono-stat">
  VYL is:
    
  

  - A simple language with simple syntax  

  - Open source  

  - Community-driven  

  - A language that is compiled to machine code
    
  

  WHAT VYL ISN'T:
    
  

  - A language that has a bunch of different versions, like C, with C++ and C# (if we even count C#)  

  - A language that is complete — expect major changes  

  - A language that is good for one specific use case; it's a general-purpose language

<p class="mono-stat">[WHERE CAN I GET VYL?]</p>
<p class="mono-stat">
  You can get VYL from GitHub; it's open source, so you can use it for free.
