        <p class="mono-stat">[WHAT IS YVL?]</p>
        <p class="mono-stat">YVL is a native systems language, it's designed to be simple, easy to read, and to be
            easy to write. It's also designed to be compiled to machine code, making it a native systems language.
            YVL is a community project, and I'm open to contributions.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="mono-stat">[WHY SHOULD I USE YVL?]</p>
        <p class="mono-stat">I'm not going to hold you on anything, this is a language that I feel is missing from the
            general programming landscape. I've always liked languages like C, C++, and Rust, but I feel that they have
            always been either a syntax
            hell, or an eye sore and confusing to read. YVL is designed to have the readability of Python, the speed of
            C, and the safety of Rust.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="mono-stat">[WHY NOT JUST USE X LANGUAGE?]</p>
        <p class="mono-stat">Go ahead, use what you want. I'm not going to stop you. This language is just something I
            made to be a C replacement.
            You can use any language you want, except Zig, Zig looks terrible. My language I feel is much better to look
            at, and easier to read and write than C/C++.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="mono-stat">[GOALS]</p>
        <p class="mono-stat">The mainn goal of YVL is to be fully finished and ready to use.
            The secondary goal is to build a community around YVL.
            My third, and final goal that I making as the creator, is to finish any tools around it, like the YVL
            linker, YVL package manager, and improve the smart compiler.
            <br>
            <br> Any other goals are up to the community.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="mono-stat">[WHAT YVL IS AND ISN'T]</p>
        <p class="mono-stat">YVL is:
            <br>
            <br> -A simple language with simple syntax
            <br> -Open source
            <br> -Community driven
            <br> -A language that is compiled to machine code
            <br>
            <br> WHAT YVL ISN'T:
            <br>
            <br> -A language that has a bunch of different versions, like C, with C++ and C# (if we even count C#)
            <br> -A language that is complete, expect major changes
            <br> -A language that is good for one specific use case, it's a general purpose language
